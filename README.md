## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! That doesnâ€™t look like an email address"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow
- 7-1 Pattern
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)


### What I learned

I learned a lot about css grid while working on this project. There are several different grid layouts used in this design. I also needed to remember my regular expressiosns RegEx to complete the email validation script:

```js
const isEmail = (email)=> {
    const re = /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
    return re.test(String(email).toLowerCase());
}

const validate = () => {
    const inputEmail = document.getElementById('email').value 
    if (isEmail(inputEmail)) {
        alert(`Email will be sent to ${inputEmail}`)
    } else {
        document.getElementById('cta').classList.toggle('error')
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue working on more complex layouts using CSS grid
